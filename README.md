# nginx configuration for ExpressionEngine

At [Vector Media Group](http://www.vectormediagroup.com) we're big fans of nginx. It's often a much faster and more stable alternative to Apache -- especially on projects getting heavy concurrent traffic. We use it on as many ExpressionEngine (and other CMS) sites as possible, so have created a template to use as a starting point on our projects.

This configuration has support and working code for:

* SSL/TLS (and has been patched to prevent the POODLE attack)
* ExpressionEngine `index.php` rewriting
* CE Cache static caching
* Arbitrary domain and URL path 301 redirects
* Forced SSL on certain sections or all pages of the site
* Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
* Far-future `expires` headers on static assets

## Instructions to deploy this nginx setup

* Run `yum install php54-fpm nginx` or its equivalent for your server OS and desired versions to install nginx and PHP-FPM.
* Place this repository's files in `/etc/nginx` and `/etc/nginx/conf.d`, leaving any other existing files.
* Rename `domain-redirects.conf` and `domain-rules.conf` to use your actual domain (e.g. `vectormediagroup.com-rules.conf`)
* Change "domain" in the three files to the main domain of the site
* In `nginx.conf`:
  * Update the `server_name` directive for the real domain
  * Update the `root` directive to point to the real docroot (e.g. `/var/www/html/vectormediagroup`)
  * Update the `include` paths for `domain-redirects.conf` and `domain-rules.conf` to match their new names 
  * Update the `fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME` path
    * You only need to change the `/domain` part of this line to match the real docroot. Here's a working example of what this line can ultimately look like:
     ```fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /var/www/html/vectormediagroup$fastcgi_script_name;```
  * If you're using SSL:
    * Update the SSL certificate paths
    * Uncomment `listen 443 ssl` and the SSL certificate paths
    * Replace `ssl_certificate` with your SSL certificate file. If you have a CA Bundle, [concatenate it after your main certificate file](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html#chains)
    * Replace `ssl_certificate_key` with your SSL private key.
  * If you're using CE Cache static caching:
    * Uncomment the include `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/domain-ce_cache-rules.conf;`
  * If you're using Stash static caching:
    * Uncomment the include `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/domain-stash-rules.conf;`
* In `domain-redirects.conf`:
  * Add domain redirects if needed by uncommenting lines and updating the examples as appropriate.
  * Uncomment the last directive and replace `www.domain.com` with the production domain to force `www` in URLs
* In `domain-rules.conf`:
  * Look for the rule that replaces `.htaccess` `Deny` files. Replace `system` with the site's actual `system`/control panel path.
  * Add any other folders/paths that would usually need `Deny from all` to this directive (remember, nginx doesn't parse `.htaccess` files)
  * Uncomment any other commented blocks if you need any of the other rules in place. We've left a few examples to follow.

* In `domain-ce_cache-rules.conf`:
   * If you're using CE Cache static caching, replace `xxxxxx` in the cache path with the actual value provided by CE Cache.

  
### Server notes
  * On CentOS or RHEL run the following to start nginx and PHP-FPM, and make sure they start on reboot:

```bash
service nginx start
chkconfig nginx on
service php-fpm start
chkconfig php-fpm on
```

  * You'll need to run `service nginx reload` for any config changes to take effect.
